# Addon Requests
Suggest addons that you want a developer to create.

 - When suggesting an addon, please search here to make sure it's not already suggested. Also check #plugin-links and #theme-links in our Discord to make sure it doesn't already exist.
 - Be respectful and polite when making addon requests. Developers are not obligated to create addons for you, and being demanding or rude is not an effective way to get what you want.
 - Avoid making repetitive addon requests. If you have already suggested an addon and it has not been created yet, please do not keep asking for it repeatedly.
 - If you are suggesting a paid addon, please be clear about the price range you are willing to pay.
 - Please refrain from spamming the discussions with irrelevant messages or comments that are not related to addon requests.
